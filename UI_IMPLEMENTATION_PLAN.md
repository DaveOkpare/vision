# UI Implementation Plan

## Overview
Build a simple web interface for image upload and object detection using Next.js with shadcn/ui components. The interface will connect to the existing Python detection backend and focus on functionality with neutral styling.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. ~~Analyze Existing Project Structure~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- ~~Review current Python detection capabilities in `spatial_detector.py` and `main.py`~~ ✅
- ~~Understand the pydantic-ai agent setup and detection workflow~~ ✅
- ~~Identify integration points between frontend and backend~~ ✅

**Key findings:**
- Python backend uses `SimpleSpatialDetector` with recursive grid analysis
- Supports both single and multi-object detection
- Returns bounding boxes, confidence scores, and result images
- Requires OpenAI API key and uses pydantic-ai framework

### 2. ~~Set Up Next.js Frontend with shadcn/ui~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- ~~Initialize shadcn/ui components in the existing Next.js project~~ ✅
- ~~Configure neutral color scheme and basic styling~~ ✅
- Set up required dependencies for file uploads and API communication

### 3. Create Image Upload Component
- Build drag-and-drop image upload interface using shadcn Card and Input components
- Add image preview functionality
- Support common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Include file size validation and error handling

### 4. Build Detection Input Field
- Create input field for specifying what items to detect
- Add placeholder text and validation
- Consider using shadcn Input or Textarea components
- Allow multiple detection targets separated by commas

### 5. Create API Endpoint
- Build Next.js API route to handle image uploads
- Connect frontend to Python detection backend
- Handle file processing and response formatting
- Implement proper error handling and status codes

### 6. Implement Result Display Component
- Create component to display detected objects
- Show detection confidence scores if available
- Display results in a clean, organized format using shadcn components
- Consider using Cards or Tables for result presentation

### 7. Add Loading States and Error Handling
- Implement loading spinners during detection processing
- Add error messages for failed uploads or detection errors
- Include progress indicators for better user experience
- Handle network timeouts and connection issues

### 8. ~~Apply Neutral Styling and Functionality Focus~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- ~~Use neutral color palette (grays, whites, subtle accents)~~ ✅
- ~~Prioritize clean, minimalist design~~ ✅
- ~~Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes~~ ✅
- ~~Focus on usability over visual complexity~~ ✅

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js + shadcn/ui)
- Image upload component with drag-and-drop
- Detection input field
- Results display component
- API integration layer

### Backend Integration
- Next.js API routes
- Connection to existing Python detection system
- File handling and processing
- Response formatting

### Key Components
1. `ImageUpload` - File upload with preview
2. `DetectionInput` - Target specification input
3. `DetectionResults` - Results display
4. `LoadingState` - Processing indicators
5. API route `/api/detect` - Backend integration

## Success Criteria
- Users can easily upload images via drag-and-drop or click
- Users can specify detection targets in natural language
- Detection results are clearly displayed with confidence scores
- Interface is responsive and accessible
- Loading states provide clear feedback
- Error handling is robust and user-friendly
